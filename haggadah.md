# Before the Meal

## setting the table ##

On the table, in front of the person who conducts the service, place a large platter containing Seder symbols:

1. Three matzos each of which is covered separately in the folds of a napkin or special cover. These are also taken to represent the three religious divisions of Israel: the "Cohanim" (priests), "Levi'im" (associate priests/musicians) and "Yisroel" (lay-Israelite).
2. The roasted shank-bone (of a lamb).
3. A roasted egg.

Also: a piece of horseradish, a bit of kharoset, and a spray of parsley.

Besides these, place on the table:

1. bitter herbs (horseradish), cut into small pieces
2. kharoset
3. parsley
4. salt water

A cup of wine is placed at each plate, and a brimming goblet in the center of the table for the prophet Elijah.

The meal served during the Seder follows the form of a banquet of olden times. Hence the reference, in the Hebrew texts of the Four Questions, to the custom of reclining on the left side—a position assumed by free men.

The table is usually spread with the best of the family's china and silverware, and adorned with flowers, in keeping with the festive spirit.

## Lighting the Festival Lights ##

To symbolize the joy which the festival brings into the Jewish home, the mistress kindles the lights and recites the following blessing:

*Baruch attah adonoi elohenu melech ha‘olom asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu l’hadlik ner shel (on sabbath add: shabbos v’shel) yom tov.*

*Baruch attah adonoi elohenu melech ho‘olom shehekhiyanu v’kiy’manu v’higianu lazman hazzeh.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments, and hast commanded us to kindle the (on Sabbath add: Sabbath and) festival lights.

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us alive and sustained us and brought us to this season.

May our home be consecrated, O God, by the light of Thy countenance, shining upon us in blessing, and bringing us peace!

Company: Amen.

## Kadesh ##

**On Sabbath eve begin here.**

The master of the house lifts up the wine-cup and says:

LET US praise God and thank Him for all the blessings of the week that is gone; for life, health and strength; for home, love and friendship; for the discipline of our trials and temptations; for the happiness of our success and prosperity. Thou hast ennobled us, O God, by the blessings of work, and in love and grace sanctified us by the blessings of rest, through the commandment, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the Lord thy God".

**On weekdays begin here.**

With song and praise, and with the symbols of our feast, let us renew the memories of our past.

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen us from all peoples and exalted anti sanctified us with Thy commandments. In love hast Thou given us, O Lord our God, solemn days of joy and festive seasons of gladness, even this day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, a holy convocation unto us, a memorial of the departure from Egypt. Thou hast chosen us for Thy service and hast made us sharers in the blessings of Thy holy festivals. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest Israel and the festive seasons.

All read in unison:

*Baruch attah adonoi elohenu melech ha‘olam bor-ay p’ri ha'gafen.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, Ruler of the world, who hast created the fruit of the vine.

Drink the first cup of wine.

2. ‏כַּרְפַּס‎

Some parsley, lettuce or watercress is distributed to all present who dip it in salt water or in vinegar, and before partaking of it say in unison:

*Baruch atto adonai elohenu melech ha‘olom bor-ay p’ri ha’adomo.*

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Creator of the fruit of the earth.

3. ‏יַֽחַץ‎

The leader breaks the middle Matzah, leaving one half on the Seder-dish, and hiding the other half as the Aphikomon to be eaten at the end of the meal.

4. ‏מַגִּיר‎

The leader lifts up the Matzahs and says:

Lo! This is the bread of affliction which our fathers ate in the land of Egypt. Let all who are hungry come and eat. Let all who are in want come and celebrate the Passover with us. May it be God's will to redeem us from all trouble and from all servitude. Next year at this season, may the whole house of Israel be free!

The leader replaces the dish upon the table.

## The Four Questions ##

**The youngest person at the table asks:**

WHY IS this night different from all other nights?

1. On all other nights, we eat either leavened or unleavened bread. Why, on this night, do we eat only unleavened bread?

2. On all other nights, we eat all kinds of herbs. Why, on this night, do we eat especially bitter herbs?

3. On all other nights, we do not dip herbs in any condiment. Why, on this night, do we dip them in salt water and ḥaroses?

4. On all other nights, we eat without special festivities. Why, on this night, do we hold this Seder service?

**The leader answers:**

We celebrate to-night because we were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt, and the Lord our God delivered us with a mighty hand. Had not the Holy One, blessed be He, redeemed our fathers from Egypt, we, our children, and our children's children would have remained slaves. Therefore even if all of us were wise and well-versed in the Torah, it would still be our duty from year to year, to tell the story of the deliverance from Egypt. Indeed to dwell at length on it, is accounted praiseworthy.

## The Four Sons ##


BY A fitting answer to the questions of each of the four types of the sons of Israel, does the Torah explain the meaning of this night's celebration.

The wise son eager to learn asks earnestly: "What mean the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances, which the Lord our God hath commanded us?" To him thou shalt say: "This service is held in order to worship the Lord our God, that it may be well with us all the days of our life".

The wicked son inquires in a mocking spirit: "What mean ye by this service?" As he says ye and not we, he excludes himself from the household of Israel. Therefore thou shouldst turn on him and say: "It is because of that which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt". For me and not for him, for had he been there, he would not have been found worthy of being redeemed.

The simple son indifferently asks: "What is this?" To him thou shalt say: "By strength of hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage".

And for the son who is unable to inquire, thou shalt explain the whole story of the Passover; as it is said: "And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying 'It is because of that which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt'".

## Oppression ##

IT IS well for all of us whether young or old to consider how God's help has been our unfailing stay and support through ages of trial and persecution. Ever since He called our father Abraham from the bondage of idolatry to His service of truth, He has been our Guardian; for not in one country alone nor in one age have violent men risen up against us, but in every generation and in every land, tyrants have sought to destroy us; and the Holy One, blessed be He, has delivered us from their hands.

The Torah tells us that when Jacob our father was a homeless wanderer, he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number. All the souls of his household were threescore and ten. And Joseph was already in Egypt; he was the governor over the land. And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession, as Pharaoh had commanded. And Israel dwelt in the land of Goshen; and they got them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.

And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph. And he said unto his people: 'Behold, the people of the children of Israel are too many and too mighty for us; come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that when there befalleth us any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land'. Therefore they set over them taskmasters to afflict them with burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses. But the more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more the Israelites multiplied and the more they spread abroad.

And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us cruel bondage. And we cried unto the Lord, the God of our fathers, and the Lord heard our voice and saw our affliction and our toil and our oppression. And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt, with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terror and with signs and with wonders. He sent before us Moses and Aaron and Miriam. And He brought forth His people with joy, His chosen ones with singing. And He guided them in the wilderness, as a shepherd his flock.

Therefore He commanded us to observe the Passover in its season, from year to year, that His law shall be in our mouths, and that we shall declare His might unto our children, His salvation to all generations.

All read in unison:

Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the mighty?  
  Who is like unto Thee, glorious in holiness,  
  Fearful in praises, doing wonders?  
The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

## Dayenu ##

Dayenu
‏דַּיֵּֽנוּ‎

The company repeats the refrain "Dayenu" which is equivalent to "It would have satisfied us".

How manifold are the favors which God has conferred upon us!

HAD HE brought us out of Egypt, and not divided the sea for us, Dayenu!

HAD HE divided the sea, and not permitted us to cross on dry land, Dayenu!

HAD HE permitted us to cross the sea on dry land, and not sustained us for forty years in the desert, Dayenu!

HAD HE sustained us for forty years in the desert, and not fed us with manna, Dayenu!

HAD HE fed us with manna, and not ordained the Sabbath, Dayenu!

HAD HE ordained the Sabbath, and not brought us to Mount Sinai, Dayenu!

HAD HE brought us to Mount Sinai, and not given us the Torah, Dayenu!

HAD HE given us the Torah, and not led us into the Land of Israel, Dayenu!

HAD HE led us into the Land of Israel, and not built for us the Temple, Dayenu!

HAD HE built for us the Temple, and not sent us prophets of truth, Dayenu!

HAD HE sent us prophets of truth, and not made us a holy people, Dayenu!

All read in unison:

How much more then are we to be grateful unto the Lord for the manifold favors which He has bestowed upon us! He brought us out of Egypt, divided the Red Sea for us, permitted us to cross on dry land, sustained us for forty years in the desert, fed us with manna, ordained the Sabbath, brought us to Mount Sinai, gave us the Torah, led us into the Land of Israel, built for us the Temple, sent unto us prophets of truth, and made us a holy people to perfect the world under the kingdom of the Almighty, in truth and in righteousness.

## Symbols ##

Should enemies again assail us, the remembrance of the exodus of our fathers from Egypt will never fail to inspire us with new courage, and the symbols of this festival will help to strengthen our faith in God, who redeems the oppressed.

Therefore, Rabban Gamaliel, a noted sage, declared: "Whoever does not well consider the meaning of these three symbols: Pesaḥ, Matzah and Moror, has not truly celebrated this Festival".

### PESAKH ###

One of the company asks:

What is the meaning of Pesakh?

The leader lifts up the roasted shank-bone and answers:

Pesakh means the Paschal Lamb, and is symbolized by this shank-bone. It was eaten by our fathers while the Temple was in existence, as a memorial of God's favors, as it is said: "It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, for that He passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses". As God in the ancient "Watch-Night" passed over and spared the houses of Israel, so did He save us in all kinds of distress, and so may He always shield the afflicted, and for ever remove every trace of bondage from among the children of man.

### MATZah ###

One of the company asks:

What is the meaning of Matzah?

The leader lifts up the Matzah and answers:

Matzah, called The Bread Of Affliction, was the hasty provision that our fathers made for their journey, as it is said: "And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt. There was not sufficient time to leaven it, for they were driven out of Egypt and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any provisions." The bread which of necessity they baked unleavened, thus became a symbol of divine help.
MOROR

One of the company asks:

And what is the meaning of Moror?

The leader lifts up the bitter herbs and answers:

Moror means Bitter Herb. We eat it in order to recall that the lives of our ancestors were embittered by the Egyptians, as we read: 'And they made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and in all manner of field labor. Whatever task was imposed upon them, was executed with the utmost rigor." As we eat it in the midst of the festivities of this night, we rejoice in the heroic spirit which trials developed in our people. Instead of becoming embittered by them, they were sustained and strengthened.

## The Night Before ##


IN EVERY generation, each Jew should regard himself as though he too were brought out of Egypt. Not our fathers alone, but us also, did the Holy One redeem; for not alone in Egypt but in many other lands, have we groaned under the burden of affliction and suffered as victims of malice, ignorance and fanaticism. This very night which we, a happy generation, celebrate so calmly and safely and joyfully in our habitations was often turned into a night of anxiety and of suffering for our people in former times. Cruel mobs were ready to rush upon them and to destroy their homes and the fruit of their labors. But undauntedly they clung to their faith in the ultimate triumph of right and of freedom. Champions of God, they marched from one Egypt into another—driven in haste, their property a prey to the rapacious foe, with their bundles on their shoulders, and God in their hearts.

Because God, "the Guardian of Israel, who sleepeth not nor slumbereth" revealed Himself on that Watch-night in Egypt and in all dark periods of our past, as the Redeemer of the enslaved, we keep this as a Watch-night for all the Children of Israel, dedicated to God our redeemer.

While enjoying the liberty of this land, let us strive to make secure also our spiritual freedom, that, as the delivered, we may become the deliverer, carrying out Israel's historic task of being the messenger of religion unto all mankind.

**All read in unison:**

So it is our duty to thank, praise and glorify God, who brought us and our forefathers from slavery unto freedom, from sorrow unto joy, from mourning unto festive gladness, from darkness unto light. Let us therefore proclaim His praise.

6. ‏כּוֹרֵךְ מָרוֹר‎

Each person receives some bitter herbs and ḥaroses, which he places between two pieces of matzo. The leader then reads:

This was the practice of Hillel, at the time the Temple was still in existence. He combined the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs and ate them together, to carry out the injunction concerning the Passover sacrifice: "With unleavened bread and with bitter herbs, they shall eat it."

All read in unison:

## Khad Gad-ya

Ḥad Gadyo

Allegorical meanings have been sought in the Ḥad Gadyo, on the supposition that it illustrates the working of Divine justice in the history of mankind. In reality, it is a rhyme for children, to keep their interest to the end of the Seder. As in the preceding number so in this one, grown people become children. The company reads in unison (not racing as in "Who Knows One" but) with regular rhythm, as to the beat of music; or sings it to one of the following musical settings.

An only kid! An only kid,  
My father bought  
For two zuzim *.  
An only kid! An only kid!  
	
Then came the cat  
And ate the kid  
My father bought For two zuzim.  
An only kid! An only kid!

## Vay’hi Baḥatzi Halay'loh ##

"and it came to pass at midnight."

All read the third line of each stanza in unison.

Unto God let praise be brought
For the wonders He hath wrought—
  At the solemn hour of midnight.

All the earth was sunk in night
When God said "Let there be light!"
  Thus the day was formed from midnight.

So was primal man redeemed
When the light of reason gleamed
  Through the darkness of the midnight.

To the Patriarch, God revealed
The true faith, so long concealed
  By the darkness of the midnight.

But this truth was long obscured
By the slavery endured
  In the black Egyptian midnight.

Till the messengers of light
Sent by God, dispelled the night,
  And it came to pass at midnight. p. 116

Then the people God had freed
Pledged themselves His law to heed,
  And it came to pass at midnight.

When they wandered from the path
Of the Lord, His righteous wrath
  Hurled them into darkest midnight.

But the prophets’ burning word
By repentant sinners heard
  Called them back from darkest midnight.

God a second time decreed
That His people should be freed
  From the blackness of the midnight.

Songs of praise to God ascend,
Festive lights their glory lend
  To illuminate the midnight.

Soon the night of exile falls
And within the Ghetto walls
  Israel groans in dreary midnight.

Anxiously with God they plead,
Who still trust His help in need,
In the darkest hour of midnight.

And He hears their piteous cry.
"Wait! be strong, My help is nigh,
  Soon ‘twill pass—the long-drawn midnight.

"Tenderly I cherished you
For a service great and true;
  When ‘tis past—the long-drawn midnight." p. 117

O, Thou Guardian of the Right,
Lead us onward to the light
  From the darkness of the midnight.

Father, let the day appear
When all men Thy name revere
  And Thy light dispels the midnight.

When no longer shall the foe
From th’ oppressed wring cries of woe
  In the darkness of the midnight.

But Thy love all hearts shall sway;
And Thy light drive gloom away,
  And to midday change the midnight.

# Notes on Passover 

## History of Passover

History of the Passover

THE PASSING GENERATIONS

AS THE rocks of granite yield to the trained eye of the scientist the secret of their formation, so human institutions, properly examined, present records of growth. Such a story of development, in response to changing social conditions, is displayed by the feast of the Passover.

A. THE FESTIVAL OF THE SHEPHERDS.

Its name ḤAG HAPPESAḤ harks back to the misty dawn of history. Long before the Exodus, the pastoral tribes of Israel celebrated this festival of the shepherds. As among other pastoral tribes, so among our forefathers, the joyous springtime, with its rich manifestation of fertility through the offspring of the flocks and herds, called forth special festivities. Moses pleaded with Pharaoh in behalf of the Israelites: "Let us go, we pray thee, three days journey in the wilderness, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword". * When they were refused, the Israelite families offered the Pesaḥ sacrifices in their homes in Egypt.

The exact meaning of the name given to this festival and the nature of its ceremonies are matters of conjecture. Its celebration in the early spring, was associated with the sacrifice of the firstlings of the flocks and herds. The modified ordinance regarding its observance in Egypt, as given in Exodus XII, reads: "In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household; and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbor next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man's eating ye shall make your count for the lamb. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year; ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats; and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at dusk. And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the house wherein they shall eat it. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof. And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste—it is the Lord's passover." *

Only Israelites and initiated strangers could participate in the Passover. Through the partaking of the sacrificial meat, they sought to strengthen their union with one another and with God, and by means of consecrating their dwellings with the blood of the sacrifice, they hoped to ward off every harm and danger.

The departure of the Israelites from Egypt during the spring festival vested the ancient rite with new historical significance. The name Pesaḥ assumed the meaning of "passing over," of sparing and delivering, and its observance came to be interpreted as a memorial of God's appearance as the avenger of Israel's wrongs: The blood upon the doorposts and lintels was construed to have been a sign upon the homes of the Israelites to distinguish them from those of the Egyptians. Tradition described it as "the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, for that He passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses". *

B. THE FARMER'S SPRING FESTIVAL.

With their entrance into Canaan, the shepherd tribes of Israel began to follow agricultural pursuits. Among the older settlers of the land they found the custom of offering to the deity, at the spring of the year, the first fruit of their early harvest. They not only adopted this idea that an offering of their first grain was due to God, but extended it also to the firstlings of their flocks and herds. Thus the Passover sacrifice, while retaining its ancient ceremonials, received the new meaning of being a tribute due to God from the fold. It was also combined with the feast of Matzahs or Unleavened Bread, the spring festival of the agricultural Canaanite community, observed in the month of Abib, before the beginning of the harvest season. The important feature of this celebration was the eating of matzos or cakes prepared of unleavened dough. As sacrificial food, it was to be free from leaven. ** "It is very probable", writes Dr. Julian Morgenstern, "that among the ancient Canaanites and the early agricultural Israelites, the custom existed of destroying the usually meager remains of the old crop before the new crop could be used or even harvested. And if this hypothesis be correct, we must see in the ceremonies of the destruction of all leaven, of the fasting before the Matzahs-festival and of the eating of the matzos themselves, the religious, sacramental rites by which the last remains of the old crop were destroyed as the necessary preparation for the cutting and eating of the new crop. All of the old crop was thus burned except just enough to prepare the matzos for the festival." *

The later law, as given in Leviticus XXIII:5ff, combines the pastoral and agricultural elements of the feast. It reads: "In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk, is the Lord's pass-over. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord; seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread". On the second day of the feast, the barley harvest was ushered in by bringing a sheaf of the new crop unto the priest. "And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you. . .And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of your God." From that day forty-nine days were counted, and the fiftieth was observed as Shabuoth (Feast of Weeks) or as Ḥag Habikkurim, the "feast of the first fruits". (In the orthodox synagogues the seven weeks between the first day of Pesaḥ and Shabuoth are still known as the season of S’firath Ho‘omer, of "counting the sheaf".)

In the light of the association of the feast of Matzahs with that of Pesaḥ, the eating of the matzos was re-interpreted as a reminder of the hurried flight of the Israelites from Egypt. Exodus XII: 39 states: "And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual".

C. THE FEAST OF ISRAEL'S BIRTH.

It was the tradition of the Exodus that vitalized the old Pesaḥ and Matzahs festivals, and welded them into a distinctly Jewish institution, rich in ethical and religious possibilities. The national consciousness lovingly dwelt upon the fact that:

"When Israel came forth out of Egypt,
The house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
Judah became His sanctuary,
Israel His dominion." *

The hour which marked the birth of Israel as a holy nation, eloquently demonstrated to the religious mind the love of God for Israel. Prophetic idealism transformed this belief into a powerful lever of spiritual progress. "Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians", resounded the voice of God, "and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto Myself. Now therefore, if ye will hearken unto My voice indeed and keep My covenant, then ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine; and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation." ** The belief in God's choice of Israel, determined Israel's mission in the world. The high privilege imposed great responsibility. As the people chosen by God, in accordance with His plan of the universal salvation of mankind, Israel must keep faith with God and be "a covenant of the people" and "a light of the nations:

To open the blind eyes,
To bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,
And them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house". *

The conviction that Israel was delivered from its low estate to become the deliverer of the nations from moral and spiritual slavery, led to the comforting Divine assurance:

"When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee,
 And through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee;
 When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned,
 Neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
 For I am the Lord thy God,
 The Holy One of Israel, thy Savior;
 I have given Egypt as thy ransom,
 Ethiopia and Seba for thee.
 Since thou art precious in My sight, and honorable,
 And I have loved thee;
 Therefore will I give men for thee,
 And peoples for thy life.
 Fear not, for I am with thee." **

D. THE NATIONAL CELEBRATION.

(1) The Passover During the Second Temple.

As the feast of Israel's independence, the Passover steadily grew in the hearts of the people. It gained new power, when subsequent to the Deuteronomic reformation, under King Josiah (621 B.C.E.), the Passover sacrifices, like all other offerings, had to be brought to the national sanctuary at Jerusalem. During the entire period of the Second Temple the Passover celebration served as a strong influence in the unification of Israel. Josephus refers to the great alacrity with which the Jewish people celebrated the Passover, and states that on it "they are required to slay more sacrifices in number that at any other festival". He also points out that "an innumerable multitude came thither out of the country, nay, from beyond its limits also, in order to worship God". He estimates that one year, shortly before the fall of the Temple, the number of sacrifices reached 256,500, which, upon the allowance of ten to each sacrifice, together with the considerable number of foreigners and of Jews who were prevented from partaking of the Passover on account of bodily uncleanliness, * made the vast crowd that thronged the holy city upward of 2,700,200.

(2) The Passover Sacrifice. **

For many days before the Passover, the people would come from every village and hamlet to celebrate the feast of unleavened bread in Jerusalem. By the fourteenth of Nisan the houses were crowded with guests, the open spaces were dotted with tents and the streets filled with the joyous pilgrims. Beneath the merrymaking, ran an undercurrent of earnest haste, for the great feast was close at hand. The houses were being cleaned of leaven, and special ovens were being prepared for the roasting of the paschal lambs.

Frequently in the midst of their labors, the people would look up to the Temple mount, where on one of the Temple galleries lay two sacrificial loaves, which served as a signal to them. As long as the priests allowed these loaves to remain, leavened bread could still be kept in the houses. But soon one loaf was removed, and then immediately afterwards the second loaf was taken away. At that signal fires leaped up all over the city. The last leaven was being burnt. For seven days thereafter only unleavened bread would be found in all the habitations of Israel.

Now the seventh hour of the day had passed and the regular daily offering had already been brought up. The time for the sacrifice of the paschal offering itself had come. Great throngs of people pressed against the gates of the Temple, each man leading his sacrificial lamb. Soon the gates were opened but only one-third of the throng was admitted. As they poured into the Temple courts, they beheld three rows of priests extending across the sacred precinct. The first and last rows carried silver basins, the intervening carried basins of gold. The first man carried his lamb to the altar where it was sacrificed. The blood was caught in one of the basins and handed from priest to priest, each one receiving the empty basin in return for the filled one. Thus with very little delay, all the sacrifices were completed. While these sacrifices were being performed, the Levites chanted aloud the Hallel Psalms, the people responding in unison. After the first group of pilgrims completed its sacrifices, the second group was admitted, and then the third. When all the sacrifices were over, the people went to their houses and proceeded to roast the paschal lamb and make all preparations for the great Seder service, which was to take place in every home that evening.

E. THE FEAST OF FREEDOM.

During the centuries of Roman oppression, when the Jewish people groaned under the crushing burden of the Caesars, even as did their forefathers in Egypt, the ancient Feast of Freedom was charged with new vitality. Its annual recurrence came like a summons to new life and to liberty, making each Israelite feel as if he personally had shared in the Exodus. This sentiment was fostered by the new ritual for the home which replaced the Passover sacrifice after the Temple and the altar had been destroyed. While the Seder service was commemorative of the sacrificial rites at the Temple (the roast bone representing the paschal lamb, and the egg the additional festive offerings, the Ḥagigah), it was essentially propagandist in nature. The recital of the story of the Exodus was calculated to awaken the national consciousness. It became a duty to tell the young and to rehearse to one another the tale of the deliverance from Egyptian bondage. To dwell at length on it was considered praiseworthy. During the Hadrianic persecution, we find Rabbi Akiba, the moving spirit in Bar Cochba's heroic struggle to regain the independence of the Jewish people, together with other leaders in Israel, at B’nai B’rak, absorbed in the story of the Exodus all night, looking to the fulfillment of the prophetic promise to Israel:

As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt
Will I show unto him marvelous things. * Commemorating the deliverance from Egyptian bondage ("Pesaḥ Mitzrayim"), the Passover held out the promise of the future redemption from Roman bondage ("Pesaḥ L’osid"). Another belief, too, became current that God's anointed (the Messiah) would appear on the anniversary of Israel's liberation, to reestablish the fallen tabernacle of David. Several self-deluded men, under the spell of this belief, proclaimed themselves as the long expected Messiahs. Thus in all ages, the Passover proved to be a perennial source of hope. Celebrating it, the Jewish people defied their ever new Pharaohs and Caesars, declaring prayerfully: "This year we are slaves; next year may we be free men". To souls crushed with anguish the "Z’man Ḥerusenu—the season of our liberation" held out the promise of the coming day when all fetters of oppression would be broken, when the clouds of religious bigotry and racial prejudice and hatred would be dispelled by the dawning light of God's truth, and when Israel's dormant powers would awaken to new life and blossom forth in renewed glory.
THE ETHICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PASSOVER.

Israel's experience was unique from the first when it departed from Egypt. Again and again races have been subjugated, reduced to slavery or villenage; but does history know of another horde of slaves that recovered itself, regained freedom, reestablished its own civilization, its own government? It is eminently proper, therefore, that in the prophetic as well as the Rabbinic cycle of ideas the Exodus from Egypt should occupy a prominent place. Its importance had been recognized still earlier, in the code, the Torah. The most exalted moral statutes concerning the treatment of strangers are connected with the Exodus, and are, from a psychologic point of view, impressively inculcated by means of the reminder: "Ye know the heart of the stranger!" * It is remarkable how even the law of the Sabbath rest, at first sight unconnected with the story of Israel's slavery and redemption, is brought into relation with and illuminated by it. The fourth commandment in the second version of the Ten Commandments, in Deuteronomy, disregards the dogmatic reason attached to the first ("for in six days the Lord made" etc). ** It emphasizes the ethical motive, that the manservant and the maid-servant should be granted a day of rest, and employs the memory of the Egyptian experience to urge consideration for subordinates. This method, characteristic of the Bible and still more of the Rabbis, of establishing a connection between the most important moral laws and the history of Israel in Egypt, at the same time illustrates how nations should draw instruction from their fortunes.

The Prophets and Psalmists employ the great historical event to give reality chiefly to the religious idea of God's providence and grace. The Rabbis, finally, deduce from it the two fundamental elements of man's ethical education: the notion of liberty and the notion of man's ethical task.

Political and even civil freedom was lost. The Roman Pharaohs, if they did not exact labor, the more despotically exacted property and blood, and aimed at the annihilation of ideal possessions—the Law, its study, and its execution. Yet the notion of liberty, inner moral and spiritual liberty, cherished as a pure, exalted ideal, possible only under and through the Law, was associated with the memory of the redemption from Egyptian slavery, and this memory in turn was connected with symbolic practices accompanying every act, pleasure, and celebration.

MOSES AND THE TABLES OF THE LAW

Moses

"How small Sinai appears when Moses stands upon it! This mountain is only the pedestal for the feet of the man whose head reaches up to the heavens, where he speaks with God."

The artistic spirit was directed by Moses, "as by his Egyptian compatriots, to colossal and indestructible undertakings. He built human pyramids, carved human obelisks; he took a poor shepherd family and created a nation from it --a great eternal, holy people; a people of God, destined to outlive the centuries, and to serve as pattern to all other nations, even as a prototype to the whole of mankind. He created Israel," . . . a people that has "fought and suffered on every battlefield of human thought."

Heinrich Heine
_____________

To lead into freedom a people long crushed by tyranny; to discipline and order such a mighty host; to harden them into fighting men, before whom warlike tribes quailed and walled cities went down; to repress discontent and jealousy and mutiny; to combat reactions and reversions; to turn the quick, fierce flame of enthusiasm to the service of a steady purpose, require some towering character—a character blending in highest expression the qualities of politician, patriot, philosopher, and statesman—the anion of the wisdom of the Egyptians with the unselfish devotion of the meekest of men.

The striking differences between Egyptian and Hebrew polity are not of form but of essence. The tendency of the one is to subordination and oppression; of the other, to individual freedom. Strangest of recorded birth! From the strongest and most splendid despotism of antiquity comes the freest republic. From between the paws of the rock-hewn Sphinx rises the genius of human liberty, and the trumpets of the Exodus throb with the defiant proclamation of the rights of man. . . In the characteristics of the Mosaic institutions, as in the fragments of a Colossus, we may read the greatness of the mind whose impress they bear—of a mind in advance of its surroundings, in advance of its age; of one of those star souls that dwindle not with distance, but, glowing with the radiance of essential truth, hold their light while institutions and languages and creeds change and pass.

Leader and servant of men! Law-giver and benefactor! Toiler towards the Promised Land seen only by the eye of faith! Type of the high souls who in every age have given to earth its heroes and its martyrs, whose deeds are the precious possession of the race, whose memories are its sacred heritage! With whom among the founders of Empire shall we compare him?

To dispute about the inspiration of such a man were to dispute about words. From the depths of the Unseen such characters must draw their strength; from fountains that flow only for the pure in heart must come their wisdom. Of something more real than matter, of something higher than the stars, of a light that will endure when suns are dead and dark, of a purpose of which the physical universe is but a passing phase, such lives tell.

Henry George, Lecture on Moses, 1884

## Prep for Passover

A. TIME OF THE FEAST.

Though the Bible calls for the observance of Passover for seven days, the changing conditions of Jewish life before the fall of Jerusalem (70 C.E.) produced an eighth day of the Feast. As the calendar was not yet established, the Sanhedrin, exercising its religious authority, proclaimed each New Moon ("Rosh Ḥodesh"), and thereby regulated the dates of the festivals. However, its decisions were not always conveyed to the distant Jewish settlements in time to celebrate the holy days at the right season. To obviate this difficulty, the Jewish communities, outside of Palestine, added an extra day to each festival. When a permanent calendar was finally framed by Hillel II, in 360 C. E., and the dates of the holy days were no longer in doubt, the Rabbis of Babylonia wished to drop the second day of festivals, but they were advised by the Palestinian authorities not to break an established custom. Reform Judaism, recognizing that this custom causes needless hardship to Jewish people, in commercial and industrial centers, abolished the second day of festivals. Accordingly reform Jews, following the biblical law, keep Passover seven days, beginning on the eve of the 15th and ending on the 21st of Nisan. The first and last days are holy days on which divine services are held in the synagogues. The intervening days, known as "Ḥol Hamoed" are half-holy days.

B. MATZO-BAKING.

With the cessation of the sacrificial cult the original distinction between the feast of Pesaḥ and that of Matzahs disappeared to all practical purposes. The prominent feature of the feast came to be the eating of matzo. "The eating of matzo during Passover, unlike the prohibition against eating ḥometz, is not imperative; it is a voluntary act (‘r’shus’). That is, a Jew may abstain from eating both ḥometz and matzo, except on the first eve, when the eating of matzo is obligatory (‘ḥovoh’)". Matzah may be made of flour of wheat, barley, spelt, oats, or rye. Special care must be exercised in kneading and baking to prevent the fermentation of the dough. "In the early centuries matzo-baking was done by the wife daily, for the household use. In the middle ages preparations were made to bake matzos thirty days before Passover, except the Matzah Sh’miroh ('observance Matzah', prepared with special care for use on the Passover eve by men of extreme piety), which was baked in the afternoon of the 14th of Nisan, at a time when the Passover lamb was formerly sacrificed. Still later, when the community had a communal oven, it was incumbent on the lord of the house to superintend the matzo-baking for his family. . . . About 1875 matzo-baking machinery was invented in England, and soon after introduced into America", where it became an important industry. To keep the matzo from rising and swelling in baking, it was perforated after being rolled into shape, by means of a 'reidel', or wheel provided with sharp teeth and attached to a handle. "The perforator, usually a youth, would run his reidel through the matzo in lines crossed at right angles and about one inch apart. The matzo-machine has an automatic perforator that makes lines at intervals of a half inch." *

C. REMOVING THE LEAVEN.

While the law regarding unleavened bread is simple, the prohibitions of the use of leaven, or ḥometz, during the Pesaḥ week, grew exceedingly complex. Rabbinical law forbids not only the eating of leavened bread but also the derivation of any benefit from it. Every trace of leaven has to be removed before the feast sets in. Hence there arose the quaint ceremony of "b’dikas ḥometz—searching for leaven", still observed by orthodox Jews. On the eve of the 14th of Nisan, i.e. on the night before Passover eve, after the evening service, the head of the house deposits crumbs of bread in conspicuous places, on window sills or open shelves, and, taking a wooden spoon in one hand and a few feathers in the other, begins the naive "search for leaven". The children enjoy the privilege of following him with a lighted taper. Blessing God for the command of removing the leaven, he proceeds, in strict silence, to sweep the crumbs into the wooden spoon with the feathers. When the task is done, he makes this solemn declaration, in Aramaic: "All manner of leaven that is in my possession, which I have not seen or removed, shall be as naught, and accounted as the dust of the earth". He then ties the spoon, feathers and leaven in one bundle and deposits it in a safe place. The following morning, after breakfast, he proceeds to burn the bundle of ḥometz. This ceremony, known as "bi‘ur ḥometz—destruction of the leaven", is preceded by a declaration, similar to that made on the night before, disclaiming responsibility for any leaven that may still be found on the premises.

The Jewish mystics read a higher meaning into this as into all other ceremonies. Regarding ḥometz as the symbol of sordidness and corruption, they beheld in the ceremony of its removal a summons to man to destroy the evil of his heart.

D. "KASHERING" THE UTENSILS.

It is also customary among orthodox Jews to put away, for the period of the feast, all dishes and kitchen utensils that are used for the ḥometz, and to replace them with new ones or with such as are especially kept for Pesaḥ. Some vessels are retained for the holiday after undergoing the process of "kashering", i.e. of being made fit for Passover use: glass-ware and porcelain are dipped into boiling water, and iron vessels are passed through fire and made hot.

Reform Judaism does not consider these practices essential to the proper observance of the Passover.
