The Final Benediction

**The cups are filled for the fourth time.**

**The leader lifts the cup of wine and reads:**

THE FESTIVE service is completed. With songs of praise, we have lifted up the cups symbolizing the divine promises of salvation, and have called upon the name of God. As we offer the benediction over the fourth cup, let us again lift our souls to God in faith and in hope. May He who broke Pharaoh's yoke for ever shatter all fetters of oppression, and hasten the day when swords shall, at last, be broken and wars ended. Soon may He cause the glad tidings of redemption to be heard in all lands, so that mankind—freed from violence and from wrong, and united in an eternal covenant of brotherhood—may celebrate the universal Passover in the name of our God of freedom.

**All read in unison:**

May God bless the whole house of Israel with freedom, and keep us safe from danger everywhere. Amen.

Amen.

## Khad Gad-ya

Allegorical meanings have been sought in the Ḥad Gadyo, on the supposition that it illustrates the working of Divine justice in the history of mankind. In reality, it is a rhyme for children, to keep their interest to the end of the Seder. As in the preceding number so in this one, grown people become children. The company reads in unison (not racing as in "Who Knows One" but) with regular rhythm, as to the beat of music; or sings it to one of the following musical settings.

An only kid! An only kid,  
My father bought  
For two zuzim *.  
An only kid! An only kid! 
	
Then came the cat  
And ate the kid  
My father bought For two zuzim.  
An only kid! An only kid! 

Then came the dog  
And bit the cat  
That ate the kid  
My father bought  
For two zuzim.  
An only kid! An only kid! 

Then came the stick  
And beat the dog  
That bit the cat  
That ate the kid  
My father bought For two zuzim.  
An only kid! An only kid! 

Then came the fire  
And burned the stick  
That beat the dog  
That bit the cat  
That ate the kid  
My father bought  
For two zuzim.  
An only kid! An only kid! 

Then came the water  
And quenched the fire  
That burned the stick  
That beat the dog  
That bit the cat  
That ate the kid  
My father bought For two zuzim.  
An only kid! An only kid! 

Then came the ox  
And drank the water  
That quenched the fire  
That burned the stick  
That beat the dog  
That bit the cat  
That ate the kid  
My father bought  
For two zuzim.  
An only kid! An only kid!

Then came the butcher  
And killed the ox  
That drank the water  
That quenched the fire  
That burned the stick  
That beat the dog

My father bought

## Vay’hi Baḥatzi Halay'loh ##

"and it came to pass at midnight."

**All read the third line of each stanza in unison.**

Unto God let praise be brought  
For the wonders He hath wrought—  
  At the solemn hour of midnight.

All the earth was sunk in night  
When God said "Let there be light!"  
  Thus the day was formed from midnight.

So was primal man redeemed  
When the light of reason gleamed  
  Through the darkness of the midnight.

To the Patriarch, God revealed  
The true faith, so long concealed  
  By the darkness of the midnight.

But this truth was long obscured  
By the slavery endured  
  In the black Egyptian midnight.

Till the messengers of light  
Sent by God, dispelled the night,  
  And it came to pass at midnight. 

Then the people God had freed  
Pledged themselves His law to heed,  
  And it came to pass at midnight.

When they wandered from the path  
Of the Lord, His righteous wrath  
  Hurled them into darkest midnight.

But the prophets’ burning word  
By repentant sinners heard  
  Called them back from darkest midnight.

God a second time decreed  
That His people should be freed  
  From the blackness of the midnight.

Songs of praise to God ascend,  
Festive lights their glory lend  
  To illuminate the midnight.

Soon the night of exile falls  
And within the Ghetto walls  
  Israel groans in dreary midnight.

Anxiously with God they plead,  
Who still trust His help in need,  
In the darkest hour of midnight.

And He hears their piteous cry.  
"Wait! be strong, My help is nigh,  
  Soon ‘twill pass—the long-drawn midnight.

"Tenderly I cherished you  
For a service great and true;  
  When ‘tis past—the long-drawn midnight." 

O, Thou Guardian of the Right,  
Lead us onward to the light  
  From the darkness of the midnight.

Father, let the day appear  
When all men Thy name revere  
  And Thy light dispels the midnight.

When no longer shall the foe  
From th’ oppressed wring cries of woe  
  In the darkness of the midnight.

But Thy love all hearts shall sway;  
And Thy light drive gloom away,  
  And to midday change the midnight.

In the darkest hour of midnight.

And He hears their piteous cry.  
"Wait! be strong, My help is nigh,  
  Soon ‘twill pass—the long-drawn midnight.

"Tenderly I cherished you  
For a service great and true;  
  When ‘tis past—the long-drawn midnight." 

O, Thou Guardian of the Right,  
Lead us onward to the light  
  From the darkness of the midnight.

Father, let the day appear  
When all men Thy name revere  
  And Thy light dispels the midnight.

When no longer shall the foe  
From th’ oppressed wring cries of woe  
  In the darkness of the midnight.

But Thy love all hearts shall sway;  
And Thy light drive gloom away,  
  And to midday change the midnight.
